GeoTrellis Sample Server/Website

This is the delivery for the sample GeoTrellis server/website.  

Contents:
README - this file
geotrellis-example.tar - the source package for the site and service
GeotrellisExample.ova - the VirtualBox VM for the server in Open Virtualization Archive format
Vagrantfile - the Vagrantfile used to set up the virtual machine
vagrant.tar - the .vagrant directory that would allow you to rebuild or access the machine using 'vagrant ssh'.  The ssh key necessary to login to the VM as the user 'vagrant' is located in .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key.

Requirements:
VirtualBox 6.1.8

To Run:
 - Import the VM into VirtualBox
 - Start the VM in Headless mode
 - In the guest OS browser, navigate to http://localhost:8000

The VM has port forwarding set up for SSH (2200 & 2222), HTTP (80), and the GeoTrellis Service via HTTP (9090).

The command to login into the VM directly via ssh (without having Vagrant installed) is:
'ssh -p 2222 vagrant@127.0.0.1 -i <path>/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o PasswordAuthentication=no -o IdentitiesOnly=yes'
